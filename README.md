## [GitSamples](/../../tree/master): Java Before 8

This topic branch together with [java-8](/../../tree/java-8)  was the start of the idea with 
sandbox branches. Not restructured yet and just some experiments where I want to examine things. 

The [design pattern](/../../tree/design-pattern) part is moved in a separate topic branch. 

It has now a flatten directory hierarchy and not the classical directory and package structure. The examples you find in [test/samples](test/samples).
