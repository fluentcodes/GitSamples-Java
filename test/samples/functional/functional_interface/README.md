## [GitSamples](/../../tree/master) - [Functional Programming](/../../tree/java-8/test/samples/function): Functional Interface
A functional interface in Java is an interface that contains only a single abstract (unimplemented) method. A functional interface can contain default and static methods which do have an implementation, in addition to the single unimplemented method.
