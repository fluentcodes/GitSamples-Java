## [GitSamples](/../../tree/master) - [SOLID](/../../tree/java-design-pattern/test/samples/solid): Open Closed Principle
<cite>Modules should be both open (for extension) and closed (for modification).</cite>
### Examples
In [AreaCalculatorWrong](AreaCalculatorWrong) the method getArea is implemented foreach form. 
We have to change code, whenever a new Form is introduced(open). Furthermore we have no type information 
to the Object array.
