## [GitSamples](/../../tree/master) - [Lang](/../../tree/java-8/test/samples/lang): Runnable
<cite>The Runnable interface should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread. The class must define a method of no arguments called run. </cite>

The Runnable interface is a functional interface and has a single run() method which doesn't accept any parameters and does not return any values.

This is rather similar than [Callable]((/../../tree/java-8/test/samples/concurrent/callable).
