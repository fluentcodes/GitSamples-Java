## [GitSamples](/../../tree/master) - [Behavioral](/../../tree/java-design-pattern/test/samples/behavioural): Chain of Responsibility
<cite>In object-oriented design, the chain-of-responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern consisting of a source of command objects and a series of processing objects.[1] Each processing object contains logic that defines the types of command objects that it can handle; the rest are passed to the next processing object in the chain. A mechanism also exists for adding new processing objects to the end of this chain. </cite>

### Examples
* [validator](validator): A validation pattern example for registration.
* [purchasepower](purchasepower): Depending on a value a different class is "responsible". 
* [logger](loggeer): Different log levels.
